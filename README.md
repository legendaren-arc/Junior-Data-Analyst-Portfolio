### About

I am a graduate in Information Technology with a strong interest in data research, analytics, visualization, and data management. I am driven by the goal of turning raw data into clear, actionable insights that support informed, strategic decision-making.

With over four years of experience working with Excel and spreadsheets, I have developed a solid foundation in data organization and analysis. I am also expanding my skill set in SQL, Tableau, Python, Power BI, and other modern data tools. Currently, I’m actively building hands-on personal projects and pursuing certifications to stay ahead in the ever-evolving data landscape.

Combining technical proficiency with a critical and analytical mindset, I strive to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions that create value and inspire smarter decisions. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
